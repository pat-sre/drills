# Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union)
#
# Implement a Union-Find data structure with:
#   - Path compression in find()
#   - Union by rank in union()
#
# __init__(n): Initialize n elements (0 to n-1), each in its own set.
# find(x):    Return the root representative of x's set.
# union(x,y): Merge the sets containing x and y.
#             Return True if merged, False if already in the same set.
#
