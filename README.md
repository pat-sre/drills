# Drills

A collection of algorithm and data structure exercises for practice. Each drill provides a skeleton to implement and tests to verify your solution.

## Structure

Each topic contains subdirectories for specific algorithms/concepts:

```
concept/
  task/
    exercise.py     # Skeleton - implement your solution here
    solution.py     # Reference implementation
    tests.py        # Test suite
```

## Current Topics

### Sorting
- **Insertion Sort** - `sorting/insertion/`
- **Merge Sort** - `sorting/merge/`
- **Quicksort** - `sorting/quicksort/`

## Usage

1. Navigate to the algorithm you want to practice
2. Implement the function in `sort.py` (or equivalent skeleton file)
3. Run the file to execute tests:

```bash
cd sorting/insertion
python sort.py
```

4. Compare your solution with `solution.py` if needed

## Adding New Drills

More topics coming soon (e.g., searching, trees, graphs, dynamic programming).
